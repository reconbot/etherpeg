EtherPEG for Mac OS X uses libpcap, an open-source packet capture library 
that is present in the Mac OS X 10.1.3 install.  

Unfortunately, pcap's header files are not part of the standard Mac OS X
Developer package.  

You can get them from http://www.tcpdump.org, or from 
http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/1.4/source/other/libpcap-0.6.2-2.1.tar.gz
(all EtherPEG needs is "pcap.h", which you can simply copy into the 
source directory).
